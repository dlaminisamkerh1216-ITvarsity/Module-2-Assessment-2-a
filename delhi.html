           <h3>DELHI DELICIOUS</h3>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>We've been around for 15 years and we're determined to stay true to our roots. You could say that we're a bit stubborn - it's just that we really know how to make traditional pies and samoosas. Here's how we got here. To date Delhi Delicious has a 50 store national footprint which is continuously growing. With our love and passion for food constantly at heart, we continuously endeavour to offer value for money products, friendly and quick service. This allows us to produce scrumptious, unique and great tasting food. Our commitment to food safety and hygiene is essential to our business. We acknowledge our responsibility to provide safe, wholesome and strictly Halaal (SANHA certified) food to our patrons.</p>
