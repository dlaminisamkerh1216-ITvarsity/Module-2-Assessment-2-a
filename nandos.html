           <h3>NANDO'S</h3>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>The story of Nando's starts hundreds of years ago with the first Portuguese explorers who set sail for the East in search of the legendary spice route. And so they landed on our shores and discovered the African Bird's Eye Chilli or as we know it (and love it), PERi-PERi. Today, many years later, you can find Nando's restaurants, our delicious, addictive sauces and our world-famous grocery range around the globe. When you say howzit, heita or hello at a Nando's, the one thing you're guaranteed to find, besides our legendary chicken, is a warm South African welcome and a smile to make you feel at home.
            <p>Each one of our restaurants has its own unique design, but they all have earthy textures and colours that remind us of our sunny Afro-Portuguese roots and feature original, local South African art and unique design touches that make it the perfect place to sit down and enjoy the best food you've ever tasted.</p>
